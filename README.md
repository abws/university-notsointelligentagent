# university-notsointelligentagent

This was my implementation to designing an intelligent agent that wonders around searching for food and water. The agent can percept adjecent obejcts via what would be sensors. My not-so-intelligent agent wonders around randomly without the aid of any search algorithms. I was severely behind on the module content so I did what i could do at the time. Looking back now, I could've used a number of algorithms. The most suitable would probably be the A* search algorithm, with the heuristic defined as the Manhattan Distance between the agent and the goal node.

I managed to somehow get 13/15 (87%) on this cw, the highest I know of.

The code is based on the aima-code python repository.
